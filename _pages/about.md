I am an assistant professor in AI at the University of Amsterdam, with a joint position between the Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation, and the Informatics Institute. My work focuses on interpretable machine learning for applications in science and society. Previously, I was a researcher at Microsoft Research Amsterdam and at the Partnership on AI. I have a PhD in explainable ML from the University of Amsterdam, along with an MSc and BSc, both in mathematics, from McMaster University in Canada.
